🚀 Project Title: Smart Health Assistant: Predicting Diseases Based on Symptoms

🎯 Objective/Purpose: Providing a mobile-based solution for individuals who are geographically distant from hospitals and require initial medical assistance for common diseases.

🔍 Scope: Leveraging data from Columbia datasets and IEEE Dataport, this project aims to predict and offer first aid solutions for approximately 150 common diseases, achieving accuracy rates of 70-80%.

🔬 Methodology/Approach: Employing multi-label multi-class classification techniques, the project utilizes TF-IDF, Word2Vec, fuzzywuzzy, Selenium, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Plotly, pandas, and NumPy for data processing, exploration, and augmentation. Machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost are applied, with XGBoost yielding the best results with an AUC-ROC score of approximately 0.88.

🛠️ Technologies/Tools Used: Google Drive for data storage, Google Colab, Python, and MS Office applications for data retrieval and analysis.

🏆 Key Achievements/Results: Through hyperparameter tuning and k-fold cross-validation, the project achieved an accuracy of nearly 88% in disease prediction and provided appropriate first aid solutions approximately 94% of the time. This project primarily targets individuals with limited mobility, prioritizing ease of use.

🤔 Challenges and Solutions: Overcoming challenges such as acquiring sufficient data for training, handling imbalanced class data, and performing dimensionality reduction, the project utilized techniques like oversampling for augmentation and feature selection to address these issues.

👩‍💼 Roles and Responsibilities: Personally responsible for data augmentation, Selenium-based data collection, feature selection, building logistic regression models, and evaluating SVM and XGBoost models.

🚀 Future Plans/Extensions: The deployed model has potential future applications as a chatbot, capable of converting voice to text. Additionally, plans include providing definitions for medical terms and incorporating visual aids to enhance user understanding.
